This is a spigot plugin that will make it so that spectators are compleatly hidden from other players and each other. this includes removing the ghost heads that normaly show spectators and removing the player from the tab list. 
This plugin only has one command /spectatorsvisible it takes the arguments "true" or "false" and toggles spectator visibility on and off. it can only be used by OPed players, the console, or command blocks.
